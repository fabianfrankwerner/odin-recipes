# Odin Recipes

Hey there! This is **Odin Recipes**, my humble attempt at building a basic recipe website to practice my HTML skills. While the website might not win any design awards (unless you're into brutalist web design, that is), it's been an excellent journey to strengthen my HTML knowledge.

## Project Overview

I embarked on this project to create a straightforward recipe website. The main goal was to build my HTML chops, so I didn't pay much attention to making it look fancy. Instead, I focused on structuring web content, creating links, and organizing information effectively using HTML.

By the end of this project, I'm confident that my HTML skills will be stronger, and I'll have a better understanding of HTML fundamentals.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Odin Recipes** project, I followed these steps:

1. I cloned the project repository to my local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/odin-recipes.git
   ```

2. After cloning, I opened the project folder in my preferred code editor.

3. I began editing the HTML files to create the recipe website, using plain HTML for this project.

4. I added recipes, descriptions, and links as needed, organizing them logically.

5. Testing the website was crucial, so I frequently opened it in a web browser to ensure it displayed correctly.

6. Throughout the project, I took the opportunity to experiment and enhance my HTML skills, learning by doing.

## Project Structure

I kept the project structure simple and easy to follow:

- `index.html`: This is the main index page of the recipe website.
- `recipes/`: I organized individual recipe HTML files within this directory, with one file per recipe.

Here's what the project structure looked like:

```
odin-recipes/
│
├── index.html
│
└── recipes/
    ├── recipe1.html
    ├── recipe2.html
    └── ...
```

I could create as many recipe HTML files as I liked within the `recipes` directory to expand my collection.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are always welcome! If I ever decide to improve or add new features, I'll follow these guidelines:

1. I'll fork the repository to create my copy.

2. Creating a new branch for my feature would be essential:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Making changes and committing them with descriptive commit messages to keep everything organized.

4. I'll push my changes to my forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Finally, I'll create a Pull Request from my forked repository to the main project repository.

6. I'll wait for my Pull Request to be reviewed, and once it's approved, it'll be merged into the main project.
